Description:
This project is a Mandarin Chinese learning assistant that uses AI (TinyLlama via Ollama) to correct grammar, suggest better phrasing, and explain mistakes â€” all while providing positive encouragement. It consists of a FastAPI backend and a Streamlit frontend, allowing learners to get instant feedback on their Mandarin sentences in both API and web-based interfaces.
